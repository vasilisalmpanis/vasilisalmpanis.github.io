#### Why

Rust is becoming increasingly popular these days, because of the performancy and safety it provides.
Since I am interested in system-programming, and rust is really good at exactly that, I decided to give it
a go. Before I did the project, I tried **rustlings** just to get used to the basic nuances of the langueage and
as I have seen with **ziglings**, **rustlings** is a great resource to get started.

#### How
People say that the best way to learn is by doing what you like, and what I like is working out. So how could
I combine my two interests, coding and fitness? This is how **Fitness-Tracker** was born. It is a simple application
whose backend is written in Rust and frontend in plain **HTML**.

Dates and duration of workouts are stored in an **SQLite** database and gets served to the client that displays them
in a Github like heatmap. This is a perfect way to visualize your progress, especially for people like me who prefer
to see things than read them.
